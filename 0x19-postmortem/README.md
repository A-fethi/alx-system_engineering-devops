<h1>Issue Symmary:</h1>
<h2>Duration:</h2>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:Start Time: January 31 2023, 16:15 GMT+1</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:End Time: January 31 2023, 18:05 GMT+1</p>
<h2>Impact:</h2>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:The primary Blogify website was down for approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes, affecting all users who tried to access the site during that period.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:User experience was severely disrupted, and all core functionality was unavailable.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:Nearly 100% of users were affected, resulting in a significant service outage.</p>

<h2>Timeline:</h2>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:16:15 GMT+1: The issue was detected when an engineer received a monitoring alert for the high server load on the primary Blogify web server.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:16:20 GMT+1: The operations team began investigating the issue, initially suspecting a sudden traffic surge.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:16:35 GMT+1: Despite increased server capacity, the site's performance continued to degrade, and users reported slow response times.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:16:50 GMT+1: Misleadingly, the team focused on optimizing the database queries to handle the supposed traffic influx.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:17:15 GMT+1: As the situation worsened, the incident was escalated to the engineering team.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:17:30 GMT+1: A code review revelated a recent code deployement that contained a performance regression in the authentication module.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:17:45 GMT+1: The code responsible for the regression was identified and rolled back, resolving the issue.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:18:05 GMT+1: The Blogify website was fully functional again, and performance was restored to normal.</p>

</p>
<h2>Root Cause and Resolution:</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:The root cause was a performance regression introduced during a recent code deployment. A code change in the authentication module led to excessive database queries on each user request.</p>
<h3>Resolution:</h3>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:The issue was resolved by rolling back the code change responsible for the regression. This restored normal performance.

<h2>Corrective and Preventative Measures:</h2>
<h3>Improvements/Fixes:</h3>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:Implement a rigourous pre-deployement testing process, including checking the performance of the code, to prevent future regressions.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:Elevate the platform's awarness with enhaced monitoring and alerting systems to detect anomalies quicker than a detective in mystery novel.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:Consider introducing a "feature flag" system to allow for safer deployments and quicker rollbacks without turning the entire platform into a rollercoaster.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:Schedule a post-incident review to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement in incident response, with tes and biscuits.</p>
<h3>Tasks:</h3>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:Organize performance tests as part of the pre-deployment process to catch performance regressions before they cause digital traffic jams.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:Enhace monitoring systems to send alerts faster than an espresso machine serving your favorite brew.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:Ivestigate the implementation of a "feature flag" system for safer deployements.</p>
<p>&emsp;:small_orange_diamond:Host a post-incident review to gather insights, share anecdotes, and create an action plan to ensure a smoother digital ride.</p>

&emsp;:white_check_mark:In conclusion, this incident has tqught us that even digital platforms occasionally decide to take a coffee break. By sipping on these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to ensure that our digital world runs smoother than a freshly brewed cup of coffee. â˜•:rocket:
